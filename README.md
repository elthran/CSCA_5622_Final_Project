# Introduction

This notebook will be examining the "House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques" data from this Kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

It has training data describing a lot of house sales, and the amount of money that the house was sold for. There is also some extra test data which is similar but does not have the sale price.

I am going to combine this data, clean and visualize it, then use the training data to build some models to try to predict the sale price as accurately as I can. Then I will submit the test data with mypredictions to Kaggle to see if my results are valid.

The data should be attached in a folder called 'data/' which includes a "data_description.txt" file from Kaggle which explains all of the features.
